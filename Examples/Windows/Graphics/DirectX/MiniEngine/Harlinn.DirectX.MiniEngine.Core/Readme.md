# Harlinn.DirectX.MiniEngine.Core 

This example is based on code from the [DirectX-Graphics-Samples](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectX-Graphics-Samples) repository.

The MiniEngine code was complex enough to demonstrate a "real-world" use case for the DirectX 3D 12 classes located in Harlinn.Windows\HWGraphicsD3D12.h.
