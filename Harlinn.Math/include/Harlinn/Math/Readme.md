Harlinn.Math is a header only library.

This library depends on the Harlinn.Common library, which is also a header only library.

Apart from `immintrin.h` Harlinn.Math and Harlinn.Common only includes standard header files.

The `Harlinn/Math/Math.h` header file provides `constexpr ` alternatives to most of the
functions provided through the `cmath` header file.

The `Harlinn/Math/Simd.h` provides a set of <q>trait</q> template classes that simplifies
the development of SIMD C++ template classes and functions.  

The `Harlinn/Math/VectorMath.h` contains a set of optimized linear algebra classes 
and functions for games and other graphic intensive apps.
