== INTRODUCTION ==

OpenFYBA is the source code release of the FYBA library, distributed by the 
National Mapping Authority of Norway (Statens kartverk) to read and write 
files in the National geodata standard format SOSI. 

The original library has a long history, and was originally developed for 
systems as diverse as DOS, OS/2-16, OS/2-32, Win16, Win32, and various UNIX 
variants (POSIX, HPUX, Silicon graphics). In Norwegian. It shows in the 
source code. OpenFYBA has been tested to run at least on Windows and Linux 
environments. 

We welcome any contributions towards internationalization of the library. 
In the meantime, if you do not happen to speak Norwegian, google translate 
can help you with the documentation. 

Do send feedback if you think you can help to improve this documentation.

== INSTALLATION ==

The FYBA library depends on two helper libraries, GM for geometry routines
and UT for utilities. The general procedure is therefore:
- Compile libfybagm and libfybaut using the provided make scripts (or Visual 
  Studio project files).
- Compile libfyba using the provided make script.
- Optionally build and run the unit tests in the tests folder.
 
** Linux **

./configure
make 
make install

If the first step does not work right away, try to rebuild the configure 
file for your system with autotools first:

autoreconf --force --install 

** Mac OS X **

See issue #12. Replace any include of vfs.h with mount.h, then proceed with as per the Linux instructions. 
Patches welcome.

** Windows **

On Windows all three libs of the FYBA library (GM.lib, UT.lib, and FYBA.lib) 
have to be build individually.

For building FYBA on Windows project files for MS Visual Studio Express 2012 
are provided in the folders fyba/src/GM, fyba/src/UT and fyba/src/FYBA.
Using these project files the individual libs are built in a subfolder within 
the project directory and then copied to the fyba/Lib folder.
Therefore the fyba/Lib folder has to be created before running the build process.

When GM.lib, UT.lib and FYBA.lib are built you may want to use the libs for 
activating the SOSI-driver in GDAL. For building GDAL with SOSI-support on Windows
see: http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/SOSI

** Other **

Do send feedback if you manage to compile the library on any other system! 

== USAGE ==

Please refer to the extensive, but Norwegian documentation in docs/no_NB. 
Take a moment to enjoy the pleasant International mix of method names. 
Most methods have a few lines of example code to help you getting started. 

If you do not speak Norwegian, try google translating the document. 

I personally would also suggest to take a look at the  
SOSI driver for the GDAL/OGR library for more usage examples.
