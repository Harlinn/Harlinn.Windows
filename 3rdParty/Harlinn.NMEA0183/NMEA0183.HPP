      HOW TO USE THIS CLASS
      Normally, you don't care about most sentences.
      Modify the declaration of this class (or copy this class to your own
      class) and get rid of the sentences you don't care about. For example,
      if you're interfacing with a device that will NEVER produce an AAM sentence,
      get rid of the Aam member. Don't have code that will never be called.
