Libgta is a portable library that implements the Generic Tagged Array (GTA) file
format. This file format has the following features:

* GTAs can store any kind of data in multidimensional arrays
* GTAs can optionally use simple tags to store rich metadata
* GTAs are streamable, which allows direct reading from and writing to pipes,
  network sockets, and other non-seekable media
* GTA files allow easy out-of-core data access for very large
  arrays
